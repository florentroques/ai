## Data Science

### Polars
The main advantage of Polars over Pandas is its speed. If you need to do a lot of data processing on large datasets, you should definitely try Polars. The main advantage of Polars over Pandas is its speed.

**What is AGI vs AI?**.  
How do they differ? There is a big difference between agi and ai. Agi is artificial general intelligence, while ai is artificial intelligence. Agi is a machine that has the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can, while ai is a machine that performs specific tasks well.

**LLM**  
LLMs (Large Language Models) are natural language processing computer programs that use deep artificial neural networks, such as transformers, to learn from large amounts of data (billions or trillions of words), to generate text and source code on any topic or domain. 
LLMs power many applications, such as AI chatbots and AI search engines. Some notable LLMs are GPT-3, GPT-4, LaMDA, BLOOM, and LLaMA.
